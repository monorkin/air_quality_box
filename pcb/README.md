# PCB

The PCB connects all components into a single device.
It routes power and signals from the micro-controller to each sensor, and it
does some basic power filtering.

## Development

The PCB is developed using [KiCad v5](https://www.kicad.org/download/).
All symbols, footprints and models can only be from the standard library or
contained within this project.
